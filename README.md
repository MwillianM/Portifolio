Project Overview
---
> For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website. You will be provided a design mockup as a
> PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website 
> that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete 
> through the course of your Nanodegree program. Please note that while you should aim to recreate the 
> mockup, you may also use your own custom images to personalize this project.
